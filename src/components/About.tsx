          <p>
            As a physics engineer passionate about technology and innovation, I approach problems with analytical rigor and curiosity. I am always diving into new fields from the ground up. Whether exploring machine learning through spin glasses and Ising models or building blockchain-based projects, I thrive on connecting theoretical foundations to practical applications. I'm particularly drawn to opportunities where I can apply my analytical mindset to real world challenges at the intersection of technology, and innovation. I'm eager to contribute to and grow with an organization that values cutting-edge solutions, continuous learning, and impactful projects.
